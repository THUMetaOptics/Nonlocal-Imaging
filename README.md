# Breaking the imaging thickness bound with a nonlocal thin film

This repository contains code and datasets for depth-resolved 3D imaging and optical diffraction tomography (ODT) using a nonlocal thin film.

## [3D_imaging](3D_imaging/)
- `reconstruction.py`: Physics-informed reconstruction algorithm for recovering albedo and depth maps.
- `visualisation.py`: Visualization tools and quantitative analysis of reconstructed results.
- PSF data available from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17349669).

## [ODT](ODT/)
- `ODT.py`: Reconstruction algorithm for 3D refractive index profiles using diffraction patterns.
- `diff_images.rar`: Diffraction intensity images captured under varying annular illumination angles.
