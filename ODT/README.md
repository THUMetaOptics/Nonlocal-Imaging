* `ODT.py`: Contains the reconstruction algorithm combining wave-propagation modeling and hybrid regularization to perform 3D refractive index reconstruction from diffraction patterns.
* `diff_images.rar`: Contains experimentally captured diffraction intensity patterns at various annular illumination angles, used for refractive index reconstruction.
