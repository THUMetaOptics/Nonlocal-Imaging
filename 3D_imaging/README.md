reconstruction.py includes a physics-informed reconstruction algorithm for recovering the albedo and depth maps.  
visualisation.py provides visualization tools and quantitative analysis of the reconstructed results.  
Note: PSF data required for running these scripts can be downloaded from Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.17349669).
